His clientele grew and he decided he needed a more professional way to present his services, so he contacted me for the job. I designed wireframes, put together a simple spec sheet, and began the design process. I developed the selected wireframe into a fully responsive one-page website with a clean modern look using pure Css. It features several standard sections including about, contact, portfolio and others as well as customized animations (using JavaScript to achieve desired effects).",
